## About The Project


For this exercise, we need to connect to an API, get data, store them and display them to the user.
*  Get a free API key on Fixer.io
*  Create a React Native App

For instance 100 000â‚¬ to be USD 118989,00.
*  Get the value from Fixer.io
*  All currency conversion logic should be implemented in React Native for android and iOS respectively
